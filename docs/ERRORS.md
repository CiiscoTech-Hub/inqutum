# Error Codes & Remediation Hints

Every failure the API returns carries a **stable error code** plus the metadata
clients need to react: `category`, `retryable`, a one-line `recoveryAction`, and
— since contract `1.1.0` — an ordered `remediation` checklist. This document is
the published catalog; `backend/src/errors/error-taxonomy.ts`
(`DOMAIN_ERROR_TAXONOMY`) is the implementation, and the tests listed at the
bottom keep the two in lockstep.

- **Issue:** #303 — implement stable error codes with documented remediation hints
- **Authority:** `DOMAIN_ERROR_TAXONOMY` in `backend/src/errors/error-taxonomy.ts`
- **Envelope:** `ApiFailure` in `backend/src/types/api.ts` (shared by
  `server.ts` and `server-mvp.ts`), documented in [API_CONTRACTS.md](API_CONTRACTS.md)

## Failure envelope

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Memo mismatch",
  "code": "MEMO_MISMATCH",
  "category": "SETTLEMENT",
  "retryable": false,
  "recoveryAction": "Include the exact invoice memo in your transaction memo field before sending.",
  "remediation": [
    "Copy the exact memo shown on the invoice into your wallet before sending.",
    "If payment already went out, contact the seller — the hash alone does not match this invoice."
  ],
  "correlationId": "3f8c1a20-…",
  "timestamp": "2026-10-18T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

How to read the metadata:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `code` | Stable, machine-readable identifier. Codes are append-only: a code is never repurposed or renamed. |
| `category` | Coarse class (`VALIDATION`, `AUTHORIZATION`, `SETTLEMENT`, `LIFECYCLE`, `NOT_FOUND`, `NETWORK`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `INTERNAL`) for routing and alerting. |
| `retryable` | `true` when retrying the *same* request can succeed without changes. |
| `recoveryAction` | One-sentence guidance — what to do, in a single line. |
| `remediation` | Ordered, concrete steps for the code. Each entry is one action a user or operator can perform; clients can render it as a checklist. Optional key: pre-`1.1.0` clients never see it, post-`1.1.0` clients must tolerate it being absent (see migration below). |

`recoveryAction` and `remediation` are both derived from the same catalog entry,
so they never contradict each other; `remediation` is simply finer-grained.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MISSING_TX_HASH` | 400 | SETTLEMENT | no | Provide a 64-character transaction hash from your Stellar wallet after submitting payment. | 1. Open your Stellar wallet and copy the 64-character hash of the payment transaction.<br>2. Paste it into the transaction hash field and submit the form again. | |
| `INVALID_TX_HASH` | 400 | SETTLEMENT | no | Verify that the transaction hash contains exactly 64 hexadecimal characters. | 1. Remove spaces, dashes, or any 0x prefix from the pasted value.<br>2. Copy the hash again from your wallet’s transaction detail view; it must be exactly 64 hex characters. | |
| `INVALID_PAYER_NAME` | 400 | VALIDATION | no | Enter a valid text string for the payer name or leave it empty. | 1. Replace the payer name with plain text, or clear the field if it is optional.<br>2. Resubmit the payment form. | |
| `INVALID_PAYER_EMAIL` | 400 | VALIDATION | no | Enter a valid email address (e.g. name@domain.com) or leave it empty. | 1. Correct the address so it matches the format name@domain.com.<br>2. Leave the field empty if no receipt is needed, then resubmit. | |
| `PAYER_INFO_TOO_LONG` | 400 | VALIDATION | no | Shorten payer name and email to under 255 characters. | 1. Shorten the payer name and email so each is under 255 characters.<br>2. Resubmit the form. | |

## Operational edge cases

**Horizon outage (`HORIZON_UNAVAILABLE`, 503, retryable).** Verification and
payment lookups fail fast while Stellar Horizon is unreachable. Guidance is in
the hints (retry after a few seconds); operators should confirm on the Stellar
status page before escalating. No data is written by a failed verification, so
retries are safe.

**Ledger lag (`TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND`, 404, retryable).** A submitted payment is
not queryable for roughly one ledger close (~5 seconds). The code is retryable
by design: wait and retry verification rather than re-sending payment.

**Rate limits (`RATE_LIMITED` 429, `EMAIL_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` 429).** Both are
retryable and expect backoff — honour `Retry-After` when the server sends one.
`EMAIL_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` reflects the provider's quota, not the app's; escalating
means raising the provider plan, not the caller's frequency.

**Idempotency (`INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` 400, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` 422,
`EMAIL_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` 422).** Keys are bounded (1–200 characters) and
single-purpose: a key that was used for a different request cannot be replayed.
To read the previous outcome, resend the *original* request with its original
key; to start a new operation, generate a fresh key. `EMAIL_SEND_IN_PROGRESS`
(409, retryable) means a send with that key is still running — retry the same
request shortly to collect its result.

**Email outcome in doubt (`EMAIL_OUTCOME_IN_DOUBT`, 409, not retryable).** A
send stopped before its result was recorded. Check the provider logs for the
message id, then resolve the checkpoint per
[RECOVERY_CHECKPOINTS.md](RECOVERY_CHECKPOINTS.md); only resend if delivery is
not confirmed. See [EMAIL_DELIVERY.md](EMAIL_DELIVERY.md) for the provider
failure table.

**Webhook replay & clock skew (`DUPLICATE_EVENT` 409, `STALE_TIMESTAMP` 408).**
Replayed event ids are refused after the first successful verification — treat
`DUPLICATE_EVENT` as success. `STALE_TIMESTAMP` is retryable: re-sign the
payload with a fresh timestamp. Signature failures (`INVALID_SIGNATURE` 401)
are never retryable without re-signing.

**Capability tokens & sessions (`CAPABILITY_*`, `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`,
`IMPERSONATION_REJECTED`).** Capability tokens are short-lived and single-use
(`CAPABILITY_ALREADY_USED`, `CAPABILITY_IN_USE` — the latter is retryable once
the holder finishes). Request a token immediately before the action. Sessions
are in-memory: after a restart, start a new session instead of retrying with
the old id. `CAPABILITIES_DISABLED` / `APPROVALS_DISABLED` are deployment
configuration problems — see [CAPABILITY_TOKENS.md](CAPABILITY_TOKENS.md).

**Queue & job store (`JOBS_UNAVAILABLE` 503, `JOBS_ADMIN_DISABLED` 403,
`QUEUE`-related failures surfaced as job status).** Not-configured surfaces are
not retryable until an operator provisions them; `RETRY_IN_PROGRESS` /
`RETRY`-style refusals are the queue enforcing one-retry-at-a-time. See
[JOBS.md](JOBS.md).

**Unknown codes.** Clients must treat an unrecognized `code` as a generic
failure: show `error`, and only retry when `retryable === true` (or the HTTP
status is 408/429). New codes are appended over time; nothing forces a client
to know them all — `remediation` arrives with the failure precisely so clients
do not need a local copy of this document.

**Policy rejections are a sibling contract, not this one.** Policy, trend, and
simulation denials (`AMOUNT_TOO_LOW`, `ALLOW_LIST_VIOLATION`, …) return an
additional `explanation` block with its own `reasonCode` and ordered
`recoveryHints`, documented in
[REJECTION_EXPLANATIONS.md](REJECTION_EXPLANATIONS.md). Their hints satisfy the
same remediation intent through that contract; this catalog covers the shared
failure envelope.

## Recovery & rollback (contract 1.1.0)

The `remediation` key is **purely additive**:

- **Upgrade.** Servers may ship `remediation` at any time. Old clients ignore
  unknown JSON keys, so nothing breaks. New clients should render `remediation`
  when present and fall back to `recoveryAction` when it is absent (including
  when talking to a server that was rolled back to 1.0.0).
- **Rollback.** Reverting the server simply stops emitting `remediation`.
  Because clients are required to tolerate its absence, rollback needs no
  coordination and no data migration. `CONTRACT_VERSION` documents which
  behavior a given deployment speaks (1.1.0 with the key, 1.0.0 without it).
- **Catalog policy.** Entries are append-only. A code is never reused for a
  different meaning; deprecated codes stop being emitted but stay in the table
  with their last documented hints. Status/category/retryable for an existing
  code may only change together with a `CONTRACT_VERSION` bump and a note here.

## Enforcement

| Guard | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/tests/error-remediation.test.ts` | Every catalog entry has non-empty remediation steps; every code emitted by routes, servers and webhook middleware is in the catalog; this document (including the generated table) matches the code; the frontend mirror agrees. |
| `backend/tests/error-taxonomy.test.ts` | Classification, statuses, retryability and user-safe rendering stay pinned (issue #48). |
| `backend/tests/api-contract.test.ts` | Failure envelopes over the wire carry codes that exist in the taxonomy, with `category`/`retryable` matching it, and this document stays linked from `API_CONTRACTS.md`. |
